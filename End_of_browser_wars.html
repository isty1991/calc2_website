        <h2 class="section-header">Yahoo!</h2>
        <p>Though Netscape lost the browser war,it was a pioneer of web browsers and this inspired many companies like Google,
            Yahoo which replaced Microsoft’s Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>Jerry Yang and David Feiler were two students from Stanford University who invented Yahoo in 1994.They made documentation on how to use the
            Internet and many people flocked to that website.Michael Mortiz,venture capitalist at sequoia capital invested in yahoo in its early stages.
            Companies like Google and Yahoo knew how to make billions of dollars on the internet:ADVERTISING.Yahoo started putting ads on their website
            just to make revenue.Joe Kraus, co-founder of the company called Excite, was the rival of Yahoo.Their search engine was much more sophisticated
            than that of Yahoo.It was query driven.With all the advertising revenue coming in, the founders of all the search engines actually lost their
            vision.Users had to actually try various permutations and combinations just to get the desired output.This was the beginning of the end.
            This is also when Google was born.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Google</h2>
        <p>Larry page and Sergey Brin were the founders of google.Google was built on how many clicks a page was getting. The more the number of clicks the
            more the priority.In yahoo and Excite people were always redirected to the other web page.They used that model to make Google and directed the
            user directly to that web page making it really fast and more convenient.Andy Bechtolsheim,Michael Mortiz and John Doear were few of the
            investors who had invested in Google.Google were not against ads but wanted in a much sophisticated way.So they copied the idea from Bill Gross
            founder of Idealab.Bill coined the word KEYWORD.In 1988,he launched a company called OVERTURE based on keywords and links.It was an instant
            success.Larry and Sergei met Bill to try to find a way.They left without making a deal and they soon came up with google adwords which was really
            identical to overture.To compensate they gave bill gross stocks of google which made him really happy.On august 19,2004, Google went public.
            In 5 years the company made nearly 5 billions in revenue.</p>
