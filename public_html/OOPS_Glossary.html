    <p>In the Calculator program, Class Calculation is instantiated with reference variables a, b which are then passed to other methods such
        as Addition, subtraction, and multiplication. This explains the Factory method in the program. Here objects may refer to as variables 'a'
        and 'b' which are declared without deciding how they are being used further in the program. It is the initial step in designing the overall
        implementation of a program. It is concerned with declaration of the objects without exposing the logical implementation
        behind them.</p>

    <p>In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects (ex: Class Calculation for defining variables),
        providing initial values for state, and implementations of behavior (Ex: Class Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication inheriting values from the calculation)
        An Object is an instance of a Class. Python is object-oriented programming language which stresses on objects i.e. it mainly emphasizes on functions. A few example would
        be defining variables in main class Calculation which are further used for performing operations such as Addition, Subtraction and
        Multiplication.</p>

    <p>A namespace is a system that has a unique name for each and every object in Python. An object might be a variable or a method.
        Python itself maintains a namespace in the form of a Python dictionary. Letâ€™s go through an example, each Class/Method is given
        a unique identifier/name which may be used to refer at different instance of the program. Ex: @staticmethods such as def get_result_of_first_calculation
        , def history_count, def add_number, def subtract_number and def multiply_number may be referenced in the calculator_test program
        for asserting the values. A methods once defined may be referenced using that one unique name only.</p>

    <p>Constructors are generally used for instantiating an object. The task of constructors is to initialize(assign values) to the data
        members of the class when an object of the class is created. In Python the __init__() method is called the constructor and is always
        called when an object is created. When the Calculator method/class is called it refers to the values initialized in the main method
        which returns the values 'a' and 'b'</p>
