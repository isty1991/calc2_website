        <h2 class="section-header">Encapsulation</h2>
        <p>Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming including abstraction, encapsulation,
           inheritance, and polymorphism. Encapsulation is the packing of data and functions that work on that data within a single
           object. By doing so, you can hide the internal state of the object from the outside. This is known as information hiding. In the
           Calculator class, every instance of that class such as def get_history, def get_result_of_first_calculation, def get_result_of_last_calculation, etc.
           are wrapped in that particular class. So, whatever the scope of these methods is limited to that class. This explains encapsulation
           in the calculator program.</p>

        <h2 class="section-header">Polymorphism</h2>
        <p>The word polymorphism means having many forms.
            In programming, polymorphism means the same function name (but different signatures) being used for different types. For example,
            In the calculator class, methods such as add_numbers, multiply_numbers, and subtract_numbers may be used at different instances in the
            calculator_test program. This explains Polymorphism in the program wherein different instance of the calculation class are being used
            to append different values to them.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Inheritance</h2>
            <p>Inheritance in programming means when certain properties of a Class say Calculation are passed on to its child classes such
                as Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication. Variables name may be initialized in the parent class and may be passed as reference
                to its children for performing further operations.

            <h2 class="section-header">Abstraction</h2>
            <p>An abstract class can be considered as a blueprint for other classes. For example class Calculation,
                which allows you to create a set of methods that must be created within any child classes (Addition, subtraction, and
                Multiplication) built from the abstract class. The variable declaration in the Calculation class is hidden from other
                classes. This explains abstraction in Calculation.
