    <h2 class="section-header">AAA Testing</h2>
    <p>By initializing the values on which the methods such as Addition, Subtraction and Multiplication are to be performed
        and arranging them in a datatype such as a tuple, list etc. The following function may be called to Act on the values and
        assert them on that given function. The particular order in which the operations are performed is known as AAA testing and
        is considered to be one of an accepted standard of code writing practices. Externally Values may be changed taking input
        from the user and different values may then be asserted on a given function.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header">SOLID OOP</h2>
        <p>These principles establish practices that lend to developing software with considerations for maintaining and extending as the
            project grows. Adopting these practices can also contribute to avoiding code smells, refactoring code, and Agile or Adaptive
            software development. SOLID Stands for:
        <br>S - Single-responsibility Principle (SRP) states: That a class should have only one responsibility. For example, "Class Addition",
            "Subtraction" and "Multiplication" have single operations being performed in them. Class "calculation_test" is another example in which
            only tests on the calculation class are being done.</br>
        <br>O - Open-closed Principle: Open for Extension, Closed for Modification: For example "class calculation_test" contains functions
            such as "def clear_history", "def test_clear_history", "def test_calculator_add" which were defined in the beginning. If someone decides
            to add more functions to this class, the Open-closed principle allows me to add more functions to that class</br>
        <br>L - Liskov Substitution Principle - It states that if a class say Class Addition, is a subclass of class Calculation, then not
            only class Addition inherits properties of class calculation, Class addition can be replaced with other classes that seems to
            be using variables and functions defined in class calculation. For Ex: Lets assume a Class Taxes is there, then class taxes can also be made
            to derive variables from that main class and implement them.</br>
        <br>I - Interface Segregation Principle - The "I"  in SOLID stands for interface segregation, and it simply means that larger
            interfaces should be split into smaller ones. By doing so, we can ensure that implementing classes only need to be concerned
            about the methods that are of interest to them. Defining different @staticmethod properties in a class calculator in one example of it.</br>
        <br>D - Dependency Inversion Principle - The principle of dependency inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules.
            This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.</br></p>

    <img class="image_new" src="img/pylint.png" alt="pylint">
    <h2 class="section-header">Pylint</h2>
    <p>Pylint is a tool that checks for errors in Python code, tries to enforce a coding standard and looks for code smells.
        It can also look for certain type errors, it can recommend suggestions about how particular blocks can be refactored
        and can offer you details about the code's complexity. Running the pylint "filename.py" command from the terminal prompts the user
    of any exception and errors encountered while running the program. It is one way to check the design implementation of the program</p>
